# Overview
An easy to read implementation of each abstract data type in Google's language Go.

## Data Structures
### Queue
#### What Is A Queue?
A Queue is a first in, first out data type and can be implemented using a linked list or an array.

### Priority Queue
#### What Is A Priority Queue?
A Priority Queue is also a first in, first out data type, however, each Node is given a priority and placed in the Queue where higher priority Nodes are placed in front of lower priority Nodes. A Priority Queue can also be implemented using a linked list or an array.

### Stack
#### What Is A Stack?
A Stack is a first in, last out data type and can be implemented using a linked list or an array.

### Linked List
#### What Is A Linked List?
A Linked List is a data type where each Node has the reference to the next Node, because of this, it allows for easy deletion and insertion but has a slower access and search because you have to go from the start of the Linked List to the Node you are searching for.
